## :information_source: About

**Through the power of Ajax**, I present to you the MyGeorgiaSouthern Schedule
Builder. Create your next semester's schedule on the fly using this website.
Fully integrated with the Banner backend database, Schedule Builder lets you
see a visual representation of your courses, so that you can decide the best
sections to take.

I built MyGS Schedule Builder as a side project in the Enterprise Application
Development department at Georgia Southern University. As a student, I
understood how me and my peers registered for courses, and used that knowledge
to create a solution tailored to how we think and work on the next semester's
schedule.

## :tada: Special Thanks

As this was one of my final projects at my position with Georgia Southern's
Enterprise Application Development team, I'd like to offer a special thanks to
my boss, Rebekah, for believing in me and my crazy ideas. My time working with
you here was unforgettable. :blue_heart::yellow_heart:
