**Through the power of Ajax**, I present to you the **MyGeorgiaSouthern Schedule
Builder**. Create your next semester's schedule **on the fly** using this website.
Fully integrated with the _Banner_ backend database, **Schedule Builder** lets you
see a **visual representation of your courses**, so that you can decide the best
sections to take.

I built MyGS Schedule Builder as a side project in the _Enterprise Application
Development_ department at Georgia Southern University. As a student, I
understood how myself and my peers registered for courses, and used that
knowledge to **create a solution tailored** to how we think and work on the next
semester's schedule.

## :tada: Special Thanks

As this was one of my final projects at my position with Georgia Southern's
Enterprise Application Development team, I'd like to offer a special thanks to
my boss, Rebekah, for believing in me and my crazy ideas. My time working with
you here was unforgettable. :blue_heart::yellow_heart:

Additionally, much of the database code (not included in the repository) was
built by previous developers of the Course Search. I would like to thank them
for laying the groundwork for this project.

```
A note to Georgia Southern students:  

This site is – at the time of writing – not yet available for students to use.
However, I am discussing with my boss moving the project forward after my
departure from Georgia Southern.
